# Exercise 1:
# Write a WHILEloop that will print the numbers from 1 to 10 on the screen.

# Exercise 2:
# Write a FOR loop that will print the numbers from 1 to 10 on the screen.

# Exercise 3:
# Write a FOR loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number
# is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "1 is odd, 2 is even").

# Exercise 4:
# Write a FOR loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the loop, it will
# multiply the number by 9 and printthe result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
# Bonus (complete at the end of the class once you are comfortable with loops):Use a nested loop to show
# the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

# Exercise 5:
# Write a program that asks the user for a number and printsthe sum of all numbers from 1 to the number they enter.

# Exercise 6:
# Write a program to calculate and print the factorial of a number using a FORloop. The factorial of a number is
# the product of all integers up to and including that number, so the factorial of 4 is 4*3*2*1= 24

# Exercise 7:
# Ask the user to enter a number andprint it back on the screen. Keep asking for a new number
# until they enter a negative number.

# Exercise 8:
# Write a program that uses loops to print the triangle below
# Hint 1: you will need to use nested loops.
# Hint 2: on line 1 we print 1 *, on line 2 we print 2 stars... on line x we print x stars...)

# Exercise 9:
# Write a program that uses loops to print the triangle below (hint: you will need to use nested loop)
