blah there's gonna be a blah
blah in this town
See me and the boys we don't like it
So were blah up and going down

Hiding low blah right to left
If you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath

blah there's gonna be a blah
blah in the town
blah there's gonna be a blah
So don't you be around

Don't you be around

blah there's gonna be blah
Some of us won't blah
See the boys and me mean blah
Bustin' out dead or alive

I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail

blah there's gonna be a blah
blah in the town
blah there's gonna be a blah
So don't you be around

blah there's gonna blah
I'm gonna find myself in
blah there's gonna be a blah
So woman stay with a friend

You know it's safer

blah!

blah there's gonna be a blah
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long

blah on my trail
blah the night all blah fail
Hey you good lookin' female
Come here!

blah there's gonna be a blah
blah in the town
blah there's gonna be a blah
So don't you be around

blah there's gonna be blah
I'm gonna find myself in
blah there's gonna be blah
So woman stay with a friend
