Say, say, hello playmate
Won't hello lay hands hello me
Mirror hello melody
Transfer hello tragedy?

Got hello curse I hello lift
Shines hello the sunset hello
When the hello is round hello full
Gotta hello that box, hello gut that hello

We could hello in a hello car
But hello bet we hello get too hello
Before the hello takes
And hello lust tanks hello
Crave gets hello

My mind hello changed
My hello frame, but, hello, I like hello
My heart's hello
My body's hello, but, God, hello like it

hello mind has hello
My body's hello, but, God, hello like it
hello heart's aflame
hello body's strained, hello, God, I hello it

Charge hello your day hello

When the hello is round hello full
Gonna hello you tricks hello blow your hello
Mongrel mind

Burned down hello hanging trees
