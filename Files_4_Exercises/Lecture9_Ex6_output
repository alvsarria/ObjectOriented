I
saw
you
standing
there
Sandy
blonde
hair
the
way
it
came
tumbling
down
Just
like
a
waterfall
And
if
need
light
I'll
be
match
to
your
candle
My
darling
I'm
ready
burst
into
flames
for
was
just
coasting
till
we
met
You
remind
me
how
good
can
get
Well
I've
been
on
fire
dreaming
of
Tell
don't
It
feels
do
Looking
that
you'll
open
some
wounds
How
does
start
when
end
Only
here
moment
but
know
want
But
is
too
soon
To
with
There's
nothing
sometime
around
one
We
fell
asleep
escape
from
sun
woke
up
sound
storm
outside
stood
at
front
door
looked
and
said
"baby
this
rain
changes
everything
my
heart
ran
away
fire
Opening
start
end
moment
Darling
won't
see
shine
swing
fences
run
line
it's
high
time
love
'Cause
so
well
high
Oh
darling
darling
Oh
darling
